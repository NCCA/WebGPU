## TODO

Big picture stuff.

Generate a class for simple Pipeline / Shaders 
    1. colour line shader
    2. diffuse shader
    3. check shader

Complete the primitives class to match the ngl::VAOPrimitives class
use nccapy obj to load obj files and add primitves

eventually merge all of this stuff into nccapy

Also need to look at how well the Qt integration works and look at async if needed.

Do I really want to basically implement OpenGL in WebGPU or do something else?
